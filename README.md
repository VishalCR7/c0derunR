An attempt at cleaner, minimal UI for coding, because no distractions. Made in
python. [Live Website](http://c0derunr.herokuapp.com).

Online platforms like HackerEarth, HackerRank, Codechef have their own IDE's, but we aim for minimal disturbance. Also supports live HTML rendering [here](http://c0derunr.herokuapp.com/htmlviewer).

Deployed here : http://c0derunr.herokuapp.com

## Usage

```sh
sudo chmod a+x run.sh # only for the first time
sudo ./run.sh
```
You don't need to really install anything. `run.sh` takes care of everything. Really.
